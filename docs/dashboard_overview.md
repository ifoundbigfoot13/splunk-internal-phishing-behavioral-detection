# Internal Email Anomaly Investigation Dashboard

## Purpose

The Internal Email Anomaly Investigation Dashboard was developed to support analyst triage of behavioral alerts generated by the detection model.

The dashboard provides contextual visibility into sender activity, recipient distribution, and risk scoring output to reduce investigation time and improve decision confidence.

## Dashboard Panels

The dashboard includes the following components:

### 1. High-Risk Behavioral Anomalies
Displays hourly alerts triggered by the detection logic, including:
- Sender
- Hourly volume
- Threshold value
- Unique recipient count
- New relationship count
- Composite risk score
- Severity classification

### 2. Sender Activity Trend
Visualizes historical hourly email volume for selected senders to compare anomalous spikes against baseline behavior.

### 3. Recipient Distribution
Displays recipient breakdown for anomalous time windows to identify:
- Mass internal outreach
- Unusual recipient patterns
- Lateral phishing behavior

## Investigation Workflow

When a high-severity alert is triggered:

1. Analyst reviews sender’s hourly volume vs threshold.
2. Analyst evaluates number of unique recipients.
3. Analyst reviews new relationship count.
4. Analyst inspects recipient distribution for unusual targeting patterns.
5. Analyst determines if account containment or escalation is required.

## Design Rationale

The dashboard was intentionally designed to:

- Minimize pivoting between searches
- Provide statistical context at a glance
- Align with risk-based alerting methodology
- Support SOC triage efficiency
